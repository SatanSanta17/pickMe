Step 1: Defining Core Features
a. Task Creation and Assignment: Allow employers to create tasks that match the job role and skill requirements. These tasks can be coding challenges, design projects, writing assignments, etc.
b. Task Submission: Enable candidates to complete and submit their tasks through the platform.
c. Automated Evaluation (Basic): Implement a simple scoring system to evaluate the submitted tasks based on predefined criteria (e.g., correctness, completeness).
d. User Dashboards: Develop basic dashboards for both employers and candidates to manage tasks, view submissions, and see results.

Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment
a. Technology Stack: Choose the appropriate technology stack for your platform:
b. Frontend: React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
c. Backend: Node.js for server-side logic.
d. Database: MongoDB for storing user data, tasks, and submissions.
e. Hosting: AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean for hosting the application.
f. Version Control: Use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
g. Project Management: Use tools like Trello, Asana, or Jira to track tasks and progress.

Step 3: Design the User Interface (UI)
a. Wireframing: Create wireframes for key screens (e.g., task creation, task submission, dashboard).
b. UI/UX Design: Design a simple, intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to navigate the platform. Tools like Figma or Adobe XD can be used for this purpose.
c. Prototype: Develop a clickable prototype to visualize the flow and gather feedback before starting development.

Step 4: Backend Development
a. User Authentication: Implement basic user authentication (sign-up, login, password recovery) for both employers and candidates.
b. Task Management: Develop the backend logic for creating, assigning, and managing tasks. This includes APIs for task creation, submission, and retrieval.
d. Database Setup: Design and set up the database schema to store user data, tasks, and submission details.
e. Automated Evaluation: Implement a basic automated evaluation system that can assess task submissions based on predefined criteria (e.g., pass/fail for coding tasks).

Step 5: Frontend Development
a. User Dashboards: Build the frontend for employer and candidate dashboards where users can manage tasks and view results.
b. Task Submission Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for candidates to submit their completed tasks.
c. Notification System: Implement a simple notification system to inform users of task updates, submission status, and results.

Step 6: Integration and Testing
Frontend-Backend Integration: Connect the frontend with the backend APIs to ensure data flows smoothly between the client and server.
Testing: Perform unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests (UAT) to identify and fix bugs. Ensure the platform is stable and user-friendly.
Security: Implement basic security measures, such as input validation, to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

Step 7: Deploy the MVP
Set Up Hosting: Deploy your MVP on a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
Domain and SSL: Set up a custom domain name for your platform and ensure it is secured with SSL.
Monitor Performance: Use monitoring tools to track the platform’s performance, uptime, and user activity.

Step 8: Gather Feedback and Iterate
Pilot Testing: Invite a small group of early adopters to test the MVP and provide feedback.
Collect Data: Gather data on how users interact with the platform, what features they use, and where they encounter issues.
Iterate: Based on the feedback, make necessary improvements to the platform. This could involve fixing bugs, improving the user interface, or adding new features.

Step 9: Prepare for Scaling
Refine the MVP: Once you’ve iterated based on feedback, focus on refining the MVP for a broader audience.
Marketing and Outreach: Start planning your go-to-market strategy, including marketing, partnerships, and user acquisition.
